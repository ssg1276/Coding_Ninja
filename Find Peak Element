Problem statement
You are given an array 'arr' of length 'n'. Find the index(0-based) of a peak element in the array. If there are multiple peak numbers, return the index of any peak number.
Peak element is defined as that element that is greater than both of its neighbors. If 'arr[i]' is the peak element, 'arr[i - 1]' < 'arr[i]' and 'arr[i + 1]' < 'arr[i]'.

Assume 'arr[-1]' and 'arr[n]' as negative infinity.
Note:
1.  There are no 2 adjacent elements having same value (as mentioned in the constraints).
2.  Do not print anything, just return the index of the peak element (0 - indexed).
3. 'True'/'False' will be printed depending on whether your answer is correct or not.


Example:
Input: 'arr' = [1, 8, 1, 5, 3]
Output: 3

SOLUTION:-
int findPeakElement(vector<int> &arr) {
    // Write your code here
    int n=arr.size();
        if(n==1) return 0;
        if(arr[0]>arr[1]) return 0;
        if(arr[n-1]>arr[n-2]) return n-1; 
        int low=1;
        int high=n-2;
        while(low<=high){
            int mid=(low+high)/2;
            if(arr[mid-1]<arr[mid] && arr[mid]>arr[mid+1]){
                return mid;
            }
            else if(arr[mid]<arr[mid+1]){
                low=mid+1;
            }
            else{
                high=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
}
