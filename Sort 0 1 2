Problem statement
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size 'N'. It only contains 0s, 1s and 2s. Write a solution to sort this array/list.

Note :
Try to solve the problem in 'Single Scan'. ' Single Scan' refers to iterating over the array/list just once or to put it in other words, you will be visiting each element in the array/list just once.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= (5 * (10 ^ 5))
0 <= ARR[i] <= 2

Where 'N' is the size of the given array/list.
And, ARR[i] denotes the i-th element in the array/list.

Time Limit: 1sec 
SOLUTION:-
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
void sort012(int *arr, int n)
{
   int l=0;
        int m=0;
        int h=n-1;
        while(m<=h){
            if(arr[m]==0){
                swap(arr[l],arr[m]);
                l++;
                m++;
            }
            else if(arr[m]==1){
                m++;
            }
            else{
                swap(arr[h],arr[m]);
                h--;
            }
        }

}
