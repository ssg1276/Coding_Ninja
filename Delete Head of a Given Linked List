Problem statement
You are given a singly linked list of length ’n’ . Your task is to delete the head of a linked list.

For Example:-
Input: 5 -> 8 -> 3 -> 7 -> 9

Output: 8 -> 3 -> 7 -> 9

SOLUTION:-
/*
Following is the class structure of the Node class:

class Node
{
public:
    int data;
    Node *next;
    Node()
    {
        this->data = 0;
        next = NULL;
    }
    Node(int data)
    {
        this->data = data; 
        this->next = NULL;
    }
    Node(int data, Node* next)
    {
        this->data = data;
        this->next = next;
    }
};
*/

Node * deleteHead(Node *head) {
    // Write your code here.
    Node* temp =head;
    head=head->next;
    delete temp;
    return head; 
}
