Q1: You are given an array ‘Arr’ consisting of ‘N’ distinct integers and a positive integer ‘K’. Find out Kth smallest and Kth largest element of the array. It is guaranteed that K is not greater than the size of the array.
Example:
Let ‘N’ = 4,  ‘Arr’ be [1, 2, 5, 4] and ‘K’ = 3.  
then the elements of this array in ascending order is [1, 2, 4, 5].  Clearly, the 3rd smallest and largest element of this array is 4 and 2 respectively.

Solution:-
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

vector<int> kthSmallLarge(vector<int> &arr, int n, int k)
{
	vector<int> ans;
	sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
    int a=arr[k-1];
	int b=arr[n-k];
	ans.push_back(a);
	ans.push_back(b);
	return ans;
}
