Problem statement
Ninja is playing with intervals. He has an array of intervals called ‘Arr’ having ‘N’ intervals.
However, he doesn’t like overlapping intervals. So you must help Ninja by merging all the overlapping intervals in ‘Arr’ and return an array of non-overlapping intervals.

For example:
For ‘N’ = 4, and 
‘Arr’ = {{1, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 5}, {6, 7}}

SOLUTION;-
#include<vector>

vector<vector<int>> mergeOverlappingIntervals(vector<vector<int>> &arr){
	// Write your code here.
	int n=arr.size();
	sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
	vector<vector<int>> ans;

	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
          if (ans.empty() || arr[i][0] > ans.back()[1]) {
             ans.push_back(arr[i]);
		  }
		  else{
			  ans.back()[1]=max(arr[i][1],ans.back()[1]);
		  }
    }
	return ans;
	
}
