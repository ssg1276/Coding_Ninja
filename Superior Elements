Problem statement
There is an integer array ‘a’ of size ‘n’.
An element is called a Superior Element if it is greater than all the elements present to its right.

You must return an array all Superior Elements in the array ‘a’.
Note:
The last element of the array is always a Superior Element. 
Example
Input: a = [1, 2, 3, 2], n = 4
Output: 2 3

Explanation: 
a[ 2 ] = 3 is greater than a[ 3 ]. Hence it is a Superior Element. 
a[ 3 ] = 2 is the last element. Hence it is a Superior Element.
The final answer is in sorted order.

SOLUTION:-
vector<int> superiorElements(vector<int>&a) {
    // Write your code here.
    vector<int> ans;
    int n=a.size();
    ans.push_back(a[n-1]);
    int leader=a[n-1];
    for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--){
        if(a[i]>leader){
            leader=a[i];
            ans.push_back(leader);
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
